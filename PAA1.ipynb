    "ans- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."

    "ans- The __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an object-oriented approach. The __init__  function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object’s attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes. "

You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is self."
